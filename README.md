# Selenium2-WebDriver-Basics-Course - Exercises for Selenium 2 WebDriver Basics with Java Course
The Java files I coded for the exercises in [Alan Richardson](https://github.com/eviltester)'s excellent course on Selenium 2 WebDriver Basics with Java, available [here](https://www.udemy.com/selenium-2-webdriver-basics-with-java):

I can't recommend this course highly enough - it was well structured and engaging, and covered a wide range of topics, including: 
* Navigation
* Interrogation
* Manipulation
* Synchronization
* Cross Browser Testing
* Data Driven Testing
